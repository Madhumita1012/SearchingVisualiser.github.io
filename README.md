# Searching Visualiser

This is a web-based project that serves as an interactive platform for visualizing and understanding various searching algorithms. This project encompasses a user-friendly interface where users can select from multiple search algorithms, including linear search, jump search, binary search, and exponential search. Upon inputting an input number, the application demonstrates how each algorithm operates on a collection of interactive cards, each representing a number.  

The interface offers flexibility by allowing users to adjust parameters such as the size of the number array and the speed of the algorithm demonstration. The project has been thoughtfully designed with responsive elements, catering to both desktop and mobile devices. Its aim is to provide an engaging and educational experience, aiding users in comprehending the mechanics of different searching algorithms through real-time visualizations.
